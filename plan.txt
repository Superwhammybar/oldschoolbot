Goal:
I want to complete the magic skill within the bot.
This would mean that we'd unify all magic under +cast, excluding for combat use. This will either farm the work out to existing commands, like how +m works, or carry out the work all within +cast. When I looked at it, +enchant seemed feasible to integrate in +cast meaning that the +cast code can handle it but +alch had a lot of custom logic about favourites where we probably want just redirect to the +alch file command. But the intention would be to remove direct calls. E.g. +alch rune platebody becomes +cast alch rune platebody

On completion the bot should have in:
All spells and spellbooks. With unnecessary/no use spells commented out. This will allow for training methods like spamming teleports or splashing.

Ensouled head revival, humidify, bake pie, degrime and both offering spells will be included with all possible targets.

The fertile soil spell, cure plant and resurrect plant spells could be added to farming.

The Geomancy spell could also probably take the place of +cp in informing the user how long until their patches are ready.


Actions:
Check all spells exist, correct tickrate, correct cost.
Identify each magic command, enchant, alch etc.
Check viability for merging.
Merging enchant with cast
Alch separate
